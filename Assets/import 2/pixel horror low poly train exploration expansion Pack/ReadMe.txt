 the controlers just someting simple to help testing  just drag and drop the player holder in the stage and your ready to go
hopefully at some ponit i'll put up a few  tutorials to help  make a better controler if you need a hand 
the dogs not very complext just ment to show the posabltyes of the dog  and a juping off ponit 
 playerPos on the dog example is kinda usesls it was made for the clip  as the ai wolud find the player and stop alltogether so 
it was just eazer to give it a random ponit on the map to go to for efeact 
  have fun
